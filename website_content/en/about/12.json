We celebrate people with disabilities unconditionally, embracing who they are without the urge to change them.\nEvery day, I am inspired by individuals like Abdullah, an adult enthusiastically seeking employment, whose love for writing music and singing brings immense joy. I am equally moved by Rawan, whose passion for literature and writing allows her to share her unique story, touching and inspiring those around her. Their remarkable talents and dreams remind us of the boundless potential within every person with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD).\nSince our launch in 2008,\nBest Buddies Qatar\nhas been dedicated to fostering opportunities for friendship, integrated employment, and leadership development for people with IDD. Our mission is to ensure that every individual we support becomes an active, valued member of society. Many of these young adults graduate from the support sections of schools in Qatar or from the Al Shafallah Center for People with Disabilities, but often find themselves without structure or opportunities once they finish their education, leading to uncertain futures.\nThis is where\nBest Buddies Qatar\nsteps in. We serve as the bridge to their future, providing workshops, vocational training, facilitating friendships with people without disabilities, and assisting in job placements. Our goal is to foster social inclusion and break down barriers within the community, ensuring everyone has the chance to thrive.\nAs the manager of\nBest Buddies Qatar,\nI am deeply committed to advocating for policy changes that enhance the lives of those we serve. This is a significant responsibility that I embrace with passion and dedication. By collaborating with our partners, supporters, and the wider community, we aim to influence policies that promote equality and inclusivity, paving the way for a brighter future for all.\nOur vision aligns with Qatar's Third National Development Strategy, aiming to build a society where everyone has the opportunity to reach their full potential.  Your support is crucial in championing the rights and opportunities of individuals with IDD, ensuring they lead fulfilling lives and contribute to Qatar’s economic growth and social cohesion.\nLet's move forward together, ensuring that every person journeys with us towards a future where no one is overlooked or left behind.\nMashael Ali Al-Misnad\nShare\nTweet\nShare\nShare\nCopied to clipboard\nDownload App\nOur Family\nNama\nQatar Social Work - QSW\nWifaq\nDreama\nEhsan\nAman\nAlnoor\nDaam\nQuick Links\nFamily\nLibrary\nContact Us\nPartners\nContact Us\nLegtaifiya Area, P.O.
