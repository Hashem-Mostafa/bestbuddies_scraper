This program aims to nurture literary talents and enhance reading and writing skills among students. Through this program, all students can publish their hard work and be officially recognized for their achievements through a celebration and award distribution ceremony.\nSix participants from the Citizen chapter (boys/girls), 12 participants from Step-by-Step Center, seven female participants from Al Khor Secondary School for Girls, and 6 participants from the Best Buddies Citizen program were involved. A series of workshops were conducted to allow participants to express their ideas through writing stories. During the closing ceremony, three books were published featuring the works of the participating members: \"Treasure of Friendship,\" \"We Will Not GO,\" and \"The Time Travelers.\" They were honored and received books, medals, and certificates.\nShare\nTweet\nShare\nShare\nCopied to clipboard\nDownload App\nOur Family\nNama\nQatar Social Work - QSW\nWifaq\nDreama\nEhsan\nAman\nAlnoor\nDaam\nQuick Links\nFamily\nLibrary\nContact Us\nPartners\nContact Us\nLegtaifiya Area, P.O.
