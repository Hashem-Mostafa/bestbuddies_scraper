Students with and without disabilities are invited to serve as chapter leaders who plan events and engaging opportunities for members. At least four group activities are held each year, both in and outside of school.  Some examples are pizza parties, bowling outings, kickball games, and ice cream socials. Each chapter determines its own activities based on the availability of the members.  Most importantly, members will be “matched” in a one-to-one friendship in all best Buddies programs based on age, gender, language, and shared hobbies and interests.\nDownload App\nOur Family\nNama\nQatar Social Work - QSW\nWifaq\nDreama\nEhsan\nAman\nAlnoor\nDaam\nQuick Links\nFamily\nLibrary\nContact Us\nPartners\nContact Us\nLegtaifiya Area, P.O.
